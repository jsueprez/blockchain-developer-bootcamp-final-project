# Final project - Criollo
### About
Criollo is a NFT Store project that combine the nature of art, the tasty flavor of chocolate and the technology behind the blockchain to create the most unique experience.  

This project was inspired by [@aisthisi_nft](https://aisthisi.art/)

## Project description
Inititally, for the purpose of this final project, Criollo will consists on two parties:

Covered in  the final Project
- Criollo[Contract owner], will mint all the NFT.

- The buyer[Token owner], could buy/trade the NFT.

## Simple workflow
1. Criollo create the art.
2. Criollo mint NFT, set an initial price.
3. Criollo list the NFT to the Market Place.
4. The buyer could buy only NFTs that are in Criollo's Market Place.
5. Once the buyer buys a NFT, NFT get locked, so the buyer could not sell/transfer it.
6. Criollo send the physical asset(Criollos's Chocolate) to the buyer and update the status of the NFT.
7. Once the buyer received the physical asset, the NFT can be unlocked by the buyer.
8. The buys can now sell/transfer the NFT.
9. Criollo has the possibility to withdraw funds received by the sales of the NFT.
